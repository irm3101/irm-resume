<h2>STORAGE AND RETRIVAL OF DATA USING RFID</h2>
      <P>Near Field Communication(NFC) is an emerging wireless Short-Range communication technology that is based on existing standards of the radio frequency identification application scenarios for contactless transactions, in particular services for mobile payments  and over the air ticketing. The intension of this paper is to describe basic characteristics and benefits of the under laying technology, to classify modes of operation and to present various cases. Both existing NFC applications and possible future scenarios will be analyzed in the contest. Furthermore, security concerns, challenges and present conflicts will be discussed eventually .This technology has been only implemented in smart phones so far. An RFID system has readers and tags that communicate with each other with radio. RFID tags make it easy and cheap to apply all kinds of things that people would like to identify or track. RFID can tell you what an object is ,where it is and even condition ,which is why it is integral to the development of the internet of things. Security attacks  like eavesdropping ,data corruption and modification .Interface attacks and theft, are the most dangerous for the costumer who is using  his/her smart phone for payment purpose. In this paper we present the Comparison of NFC with Bluetooth and security analysis of NFC</P>
